# MILP E-Methanol Plant Optimization - Results Summary

## 🎯 **Analysis Overview**
Successfully ran comprehensive MILP optimization analysis for e-methanol plant across 2021-2023 electricity price data, comparing three operational strategies:

### **Strategies Analyzed**
1. **100% All Year**: Continuous operation at full capacity
2. **10% All Year**: Continuous operation at reduced capacity  
3. **Dynamic Optimization**: Binary switching between 100%/10% based on electricity prices
